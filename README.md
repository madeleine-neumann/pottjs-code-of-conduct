# PottJS Code of Coduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

## NEED HELP?
If you experience harassment or other Code of Conduct violations, please contact Madeleine or any other organizer.
You can contact her by writing a chat-message to her or a private-message on twitter to the accout: @pottjs

## BEHAVIOR
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup-staff immediately.

We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. We ask that all attendees are mindful of their surroundings and of their fellow participants.

Meetup attendees violating these rules will be expelled from the meetup.

## SOCIAL MEDIA
In case of feeling offended or harrassed by an attendee or speaker, please don't let a social media harrassment happen. We would like to create a safe space for everyone and a tweetstorm or something similar is not an option to make someone feel safe. We are all humans, we all make mistakes. It would be great if you reach out to a staff member, send a private Twitter message @RuhrJS or just give us a call to the above mentioned phone if you don't feel comfortable to talk to one of us in person.

## CONCLUSION
We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venuesâ€”online and in-person as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
